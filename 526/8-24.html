Simple vs. compound leaf<br>
<p>
pinnately compound (bipinnately compound, from campus walk)<br>
palmately compound<br>
<p>
rachis: the midrib of a pinnately compound leaf, from the lowest leaflet(s) to the tip. The petiole is what attaches everything to the stem. A palmately compound leaf has no rachis. See the drawings in Walters & Keil, p. 33, fig. 3-3, b, c and d.

just for fun:<br>
<ul>
<li><i>Gammaracanthuskytodermogammarus loricatobaicalensis</i> Dybowski (this is actually the name of an amphipod, not a plant. It is the longest scientific name there is!)<br>

<li><i>Ia io</i> Thomas (This is a Chinese bat. It is the shortest scientific name in the world.)<br>

<li><i>Aa brevis</i> Schltr. (This is an orchid. The genus name Aa is the shortest name for any plant. By the way, "brevis" means "short"!)<br>
</ul>
