<H3>Euphorbiaceae (Spurge family, Poinsettia family)</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Division Magnoliophyta (flowering plants…= angiosperms)
<LI>Class Magnoliopsida (dicots)
<LI>Subclass Rosidae (includes 18 orders, see p. 203 Walters & Keil)
<LI>Order Euphorbiales  
<LI>Herbs, shrubs, vines, trees
<LI>Leaves alternate or opposite
<LI>stems commonly exuding latex
<LI>leaves simple, often palmately lobed
<LI>Flowers tend to be imperfect; thus species are monoecious or dioecious
<LI>Sepals 0-8, petals 0-8
<LI>carpels 3, ovary superior
<LI>styles 3, often forked
<LI>fruits a capsule
<LI>Pan-tropical family, sparingly distributed in temperate regions
<LI>Extremely variable habits, including herbs, woody plants, and "stem-succulents"
<LI>Centers of distribution: South America, Africa
</UL>

<P>
<I>Euphorbia</I>: produces a cyathium as an inflorescence; "false flower" or "pseudanthium, a cup like structure formed of fused bracts, within which are several male flowers, each reduced to a single stamen, and a single female flower, represented by a 3-carleed ovary, on a pedicel.  <I>E. pulcherima</I> is the Xmas poinsettia.

<P>

<I>Hevea</I>: <I>H. brasiliensis</I> is a tropical S. American tree, source of rubber

<P>

<I>Ricinus communis</I>: "castor bean", contains toxins. Source of the toxin "ricin". Castor oil formerly used as a purgative, and as punishment for misbehaving children.

<P>

<I>Manihot esculenta</I>: Source of tapioca, and cassava, important as starch sources in Latin America.

<H3>Ranunculaceae (Buttercup family)</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Division Magnoliophyta (flowering plants…= angiosperms)
<LI>Class Magnoliopsida (dicots)
<LI>Subclass Magnoliidae (includes 8 orders, see p. 179 Walters & Keil)
<LI>Order Ranunculales  
<LI>Herbs, shrubs, vines
<LI>Leaves alternate or opposite or whorled, simple or variously compound
<LI>Flowers perfect, thus the species are synoecious
<LI>Sepals 4-many, often petaloid
<LI>petals 0-4-5
<LI>stamens "many"
<LI>carpels 5-many
<LI>ovaries superior, fruits are achenes or follicles
<LI>"Cosmopolitan", most common in temperate parts of world
<LI>Mostly temperate in distribution
<LI>ancestral flowers are "primitive", featuring many free parts, generally spiraling from base of flower toward apex, radially symmetric
<LI>some flowers more advanced, featuring bilateral symmetry
<LI>many forms of floral/animal interaction for pollination: bees, moths, birds
<LI><I>Aquilegia</I> ("columbine") has bases of petals specialized into narrow, hollow tubes, containing nectar.
<LI><I>Clematis</I>: ovaries develop into achenes, with long persisting styles remaining, the style often covered with downy hairs
<LI>Ranunculus (buttercup) has achenes for fruits, often with a hook at the apex…the remains of the style.
<LI>several poisonous species which are problematic to ranchers, poisoning livestock
