<H2>Notes November 4 (Th)</H2>

<I>Convolulaceae</I> (Morning-glory family)

<UL>
<LI>Flowers pentamerous
<LI>Petals fused
<LI>Leaves simple (but Ipomoea quamoclit has finely dissected leaves)
<LI>Corolla usually funnelform or salverform
<LI>5 stamens, epipetalous
<LI>Single (compound) pistil
<LI>Ovary superior
<LI>Style one or two
<LI>Fruit a capsule
</UL>


<I>Poaceae / Gramineae</I> (Grass family)

<UL>
<LI>The most important plant family, economically (food sources)
<LI>Stems ("culms") are round in cross-section, and typically hollow
<LI>Leaves with basal sheath, homologous to petiole. Sheath is split longitudinally down the middle.
<LI>Leaf blade
<LI>"Ligule" between blade and sheath: often a thin membranous structure, or a series of hairs.
<LI>Flowers highly reduced, no sepals, no petals.
<LI>Flowers usually perfect (and plants synoecious) but some species have imperfect flowers (ex. Zea mays, corn, is monoecious)
<LI>Flowers are maintained within "spikelets".  The spikelet is the basic unit of the grass inflorescence.
<LI>Generalized spikelet morphology includes a series of distichous, scale-like structures which embrace the flowers.
<LI>Glumes (usually 2, sometimes only one, sometimes not present) at base of spikelet
<LI>Lemma and palea embrace the flower
<LI>Ovary made up of two carpels
<LI>Single ovule within
<LI>Matured ovary becomes fruit, or grain (= caryopsis)
