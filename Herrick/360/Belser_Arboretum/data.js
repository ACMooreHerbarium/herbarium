Alternate, lanceolate leaves bear coarsely serrated teeth along the length of their margins. Fruits are born in a spiny husk bearing as many as 4 nutlets. Before 1900 annual nut production was estimated at 20 million pounds. Around 1904 trees in the New York Zoo began dying from an fungal infection. Spores of Cryphonectria parasitica spread quickly throughout the tree's range killing most of the population over the next 50 years. Today, all that remains are rootsprouts that rise from the stumps of former giants. The trees in the Arboretum have been bred for disease resistance and have begun to produce fruit."
