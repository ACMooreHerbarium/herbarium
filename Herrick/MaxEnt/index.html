<h3>Potential Effects of the Invasive Tallow Tree <i>Triadica sebifera</i> on the Southeastern US Endemic Tree Species <i>Gordonia lasianthus</i> - 
Loblolly Bay Under Changing Climate Conditions.</h3>

<p>The following results were generated using <a href="http://www.worldclim.org" target="new">WorldClim</a> data for
Altitude and the 19 bioclimatic variables from the <a href="http://www.worldclim.org/bioclim" target="new">BioClim</a> dataset.  The
<a href="http://www2.cesm.ucar.edu/" target="new">Community Earth System Model</a> - Community Atmosphere Model (CESM1-CAM5-1-FV2) was used for
future climate conditions calculated for the year 2050.  These data were used to calculate predicted distributions under current a future climate
conditions for Loblolly Bay - <i>Gordonia lasianthus</i> (a species endemic to the Southeastern US) and the introduced, invasive species Chinese
Tallow - <i>Triadica sebifera</i> (native to Eastern Asia).  Occurrence data for <i>Gordonia</i> were collected from online databases including GBIF,
SERNEC, and several Southeastern US Herbaria which yielded a total of 76 georeferenced specimen records.  Data for <i>Triadica</i> were obtained
from EDDMapS which provides primarily observational data only (i.e. not necessarily specimen based records), but is much more robust yielding > 8,000
records.  We used MaxEnt (details needed here) for all modeling simulations.</p>

<p>Initial models were run separately for each species using occurrence data and the WorldClim/BioClim datasets.  Response curves for these models
indicate that different climatological variables may affect the predicted distributions for each species.</p>

</p>

<p>We then tried to test for interaction between the predicted distributions for <i>Triadica</i> and those of <i>Gordonia</i> by adding the output
from the initial <i>Triadica</i> model to the <i>Gordonia</i> model.  Conveniently, MaxEnt provides the predicted distribution as an ASCII file
(file format required for environmental layers) and preserves the original dimensions.  Therefore, we simply added the current predicted distribution
for <i>Triadica</i> to the set of current environmental layers and similarly placed the predicted distribution under future conditions in the set of
variables included in the year 2050 dataset.  Recognizing that the values in both distribution layers are between 0 and 1, we suspected that the
model might interpret these conditions as favorable and therefore would potentially increase the number of predicted permissive sites for
<i>Gordonia</i>.  Comparing the results of this model (fig.3) to those of the 'Gordonia-only' model (fig.1) there appears to be a slight increase in
permissive sites centered around Fayetteville, NC.</p>

<br>
<p>Proposing that an invasive species that behaves like <i>Triadica sebifera</i> could possibly have a beneficial effect on the potential distribution
of a native species like <i>Gordonia lasianthus</i> which is easily out-competed seems unrealistic.  In an attempt to demonstrate the more realistic
negative impact that <i>Triadica</i> would have on <i>Gordonia</i> we developed a second model with a modified distribution layer for <i>Triadica</i>.
Using ArcMap, we imported the predicted distributions for <i>Triadica</i> from the previous trial (fig.2) and calculated the inverse values for all
cells.  Therefore, all values were changed from between 0 and 1 to between 0 and -1.  This assumes that a highly permissive site for <i>Triadica</i>
would have an equally negative impact on <i>Gordonia</i>.  This model yielded more realistic predictions and showed a marked decrease in the number
of permissive sites predicted for <i>Gordonia lasianthus</i>.  These results may indicate that the effects of invasive species coupled with changing
climate conditions may compound the pressures encountered by narrow endemic species.</p>

<h2>Wide Ranging Southeastern United States Endemics</h2>
<p>Longleaf Pine (<i>Pinus palustris</i>) and Loblolly Bay (<i>Gordonia lasianthus</i>) are endemic to the southeastern Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains.
While their ranges (<a href="http://esp.cr.usgs.gov/data/little/pinupalu.pdf" target="new">P. palustris</a>,
<a href="http://esp.cr.usgs.gov/data/little/gordlasi.pdf" target="new">G. lasianthus</a>) overlap, the two species are only loosely associated with one
another often as a result of habitat mosaics. Longleaf Pine is found in diverse habitats ranging from xeric sandhills to seasonally-inundated,
low-relief flatwoods.  Whereas, Loblolly Bay prefers lower elevations in close proximity to water - typically Carolina Bays and pocosins.</p>

<p>The following results were generated using NARR data for Surface Level Geopotential Height and the Monthly Means for Soil Moisture at 0cm,
Evaporation Rate, and Air Temperature at 2m, for the months of February and August in the year 1979.  We ran 15 replicates using subsampling and
randomly tested on 25% of the occurrence data for each species. No absence data were included in these runs.  When including bias files to define 
pseudo absences the models performed poorly.  We are currently evaluating alternative background samples, and collecting additional occurrence data
in order to improve model performance with the use of absence (or pseudo absence) data.</p>
