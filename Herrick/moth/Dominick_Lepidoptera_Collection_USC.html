This collection consists of over 26,000 individuals representing >1,100 species. The strengths of this collection are that it is a fairly in depth collection of moths and butterflies that existed in the McClellenville area during the years of the collection, around 1970.  Most of the species were collected on the Dominick property, The Wedge, originally a rice plantation on the South Santee River, about 1 mile east of Coast Highway 17.  Dominick was a collector of extraordinary expertise.<p><p><p>

The moths were collected by Dr. Richard B. Dominick at 

his home on The Wedge Plantation, (on the South Santee River near McClellanville, 

South Carolina) from around 1965-1975.  The collection was moved from The Wedge 

Plantation to the Columbia Campus of the University of South Carolina in March, 

1993.  It is currently a University of South Carolina McKissick Museum Collection,

and is housed in the Department of Biological Science under the charge of its 

curator.

<p> 

The collection includes information of catch times (time of day, 

month and year) and method of collection (reared, light trap, bait, etc); host 

plant information is preserved with certain species, as are life stage forms 

(freeze dried larvae and pupae).  The collection is fully catalogued.  

The collection is available for research use; however, we are not able at this 

time to make loan of any specimens.
