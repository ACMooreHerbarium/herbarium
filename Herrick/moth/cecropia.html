The moth in the picture is <i>Hyalophora cecropia</i> and is a  relatively common wild silk moth around hardwoods in many parts of North America.  The <a href="cecropia-w.html"><b>wing coloration</b></a> is really striking.  Interestingly, many of the same colors seen in the wing are also present in the <a href="cecropia-l.html"> <b>caterpillar</b></a>.<p>

There are several other species of <i>Hyalophora</i>
that look quite similar; one in the Northwest eats conifers.  Cecropia has
been used for some years as a laboratory animal for studying hormone
action on development.  The caterpillars are easy to raise on wild
cherry.  The adults have a brief flight period around sunrise that lasts a
couple of hours; primarily for mating and egg laying. <p>
