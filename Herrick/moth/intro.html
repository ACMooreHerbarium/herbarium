The Richard B. Dominick Moth and Butterfly Collection consists of 25,215 moths and 1,758 
butterflies of which there are 1,167 species; the collection is currently located on the Columbia 
Campus of the University of South Carolina.  All specimens were collected by Dr. Dominick at 
his home on The Wedge Plantation between around 1965 and 1975; The Wedge is a former rice 
plantation, located 5 miles north of McClellanville, South Carolina, and consisting of a mixed 
habitat of impounded rice fields, cypress swamps and a mixed pine-hardwood forest including live oaks
and giant Magnolias. The property is transected by the fresh to brackish South Santee River, which 
divides The Wedge into approximately 650 and 850 acre tracts.<p>

For some years The Wedge has been part of the School of Public Health at The University of South Carolina,
serving as The International Center for Public Health Research focusing on the control
vector-borne desease (e.g. mosquito).  The site hosted on site research and frequent international
courses in mosquito identification and control.  This program is currently being terminated and
the property being considered for sale.<p>

The moth collection was moved from The Wedge to Columbia in March 1993 and is currently part of the University of South Carolina McKissick Museum Collections.  Access to the collection for research purposes can be arrainged by contacting<p>

The collection was the result of the lifelong interest of Dr. Dominick, a physician.  Dr. 
Dominick played a central role in reevaluating the phylogeny of moth species in North America.  
A series of monographs organized as fascicles of "The Moths of America North of Mexico" was 
published through the joint effort of Dr. Dominick and E.W. Classey; from 1971 to l978 13 
fascicles were published on 13 superfamilies of moths.  Many individuals assisted 
Dr. Dominick in this enterprise; those recognized as the principal contributors include 
Dr. D. C. Ferguson (1978), Dr. J. G. Franclemont (1973), Dr. Ronald W. Hodges (1971), (1974),
 (1978), Dr. E. G. Munroe (1972), (1973), (1976), and Mr. Charles R. Edwards.
<p>
The cataloging of the Dominick Collection was done by Dr. F. Lance Wallace of The Citadel, 
Charleston SC; Dr. Wallace maintained the collection from 1983 to 1992, updating the 
collection to coincide with the numbering system and revisions occurring in the <i>Check List of 
the Lepidoptera of America North of Mexico</i>.  In his original checklist, Dr. Wallace includes 
the following acknowledgement:<p>
"I would like to thank Dr. Mac A Tidwell, Professor, Department of Environmental
Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, for his 
support and encouragement, as well as Mrs. Beverly M. Powell and Lt. Col. Rex K. 
Skanchy for the long hours spent in helping organize this manuscript."
