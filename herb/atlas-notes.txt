summary to date:

- 6520 total shots taken

- 1672 kept and identified

- 980 web-ready photos collected, representing 476 species, or approx. 15% of the flora of S. C.  (based on an estimate of 3100 species in the state)

- 368 linked

- All Atlas pages restructured to accommodate photographs in addition to maps.  This necessitated rewriting the HTML entry for each plant; in the version presently online, each scientific name is a hyperlink to a map, and thus does not accomodate multiple links.  The HTML was re-written using a macro I designed; however, the photo links have to be added by hand.

activities: 

-field photography
-identification
-photo editing (photo selection, cropping, etc.)
-HTML/programming



Shall we also direct them to our site to view the plant photos taken for children, since this is an "instructional innovation" grant?  Warning: many of these photos suck.  However, they DO serve the purpose for which they were created, and a number of the students commented that these photos were helpful study aids.  Several students even printed them out and made flash cards.  






IMPORTANT NOTE:
Tim has his passwords set to expire every 6 months or so ... maybe it's 3 ... anyway, I totally forgot that, tried to upload over the weekend, and of course, my password is dead.  So, uploading a demo is out.  No matter.  I put it on CD.  It will work same as viewing it online.
