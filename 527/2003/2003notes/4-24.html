<h1>NOTES April 24 (Th)</h1>

<h2>Malvaceae (Mallow Family)</h2>

<ul>
<li>5 sepals, 5 petals
<li>many stamens, filaments connate to form a tube (androphore)
<li>petals free, but often individually adnate to androphore
<li>leaves often palmately lobed
<li>fruit a schizocarp or capsule
<li>schizocarp: ovary separates into individual carpels at maturity (ex. <i>Modiola</i>); carpels serve as the unit of dispersal
<li>capsule: ovary dehisces to release the seeds
<li>many species cultivated for their showy flowers (ex. <i>Hibiscus</i>)
<li>cotton (<i>Gossypium</i>) is a member of this family - a cotton boll is a capsule
<li>okra is also a member of this family
</ul>

***thyrse = determinate inflorescences in an indeterminate arrangement - ex. a "raceme" of cymes; <i>Salvia lyrata</i> is a good illustration.
