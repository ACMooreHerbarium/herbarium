<h1>NOTES 4 March</h1>


<h2>I. Fruits from one pistil (simple fruits)</h2>

<ul><h3>A. fleshy fruits</h3>

<ul>
<li>berry (many-seeded)</li>
<li>drupe (one-seeded)</li>
<li>pome (rose family...ovary + hypanthium)...</li>
<li>hesperidium - berry, with leathery rind and oil glands...orange family (Rutaceae) </li>
<li>pepo - berry with hard shell(ex. gourd)</li>
</ul>


<h3>B. dry fruits</h3>

INDEHISCENT<br>
<ul>
<li>achene - single-seeded, seed and pericarp attached only by ovule stalk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;&nbsp;samara - winged achene<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;&nbspcypsella - achene with adnate calyx (pappus), ex. Taraxacum</li>
<li>caryopsis - grain (single seed, seed coat + pericarp completely adnate).  Limited to grasses.</li>
<li>nut - one-seeded, hard exocarp, often subtended by an involucre,  ex. acorn + cup</li>
</ul>
<p>
DEHISCENT<br>
<ul>
<li>follicle - 1 carpel, one seam
<li>legume - 1 carpel, 2 seams
<li>capsule - 2 or more carpels, opens to release seeds.  Can dehisce in a variety of ways, generally with 2 or more seams.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;&nbspsilique - specialized capsule, 2-carpellate, dehiscing along 2 seams, falling away from a central papery membrane.  Found only in Brassicaceae.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;&nbsp;silicle - short (less than 2x as long as wide) silique<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;&nbspcircumcissile capsule - dehiscing along a horizontal ring, like jar + lid</li>
<li>schizocarp - not a kind of capsule.  Fruit does not break open to release seeds; instead fruit breaks into 1-carpellate sections (mericarps) that fall away with seeds inside.  (If the mericarps also dehisce, releasing the seeds, then it becomes a schizocarpic capsule.)</li>
nutlet - breaks into one-seeded, HALF-carpellate segments. (a mericarp is a complete carpel.)</li>
</ul></ul>

<h2>II. fruits from more than one pistil</h2>

<ul>
<li>aggregate fruits (more than one pistil, but all from a single flower) - mass of simple fruits from an apocarpous gynoecium; each pistil matures into one simple fruit.  ex: blackberry, strawberry, magnolia</li>
<li>multiple fruits - one fruit from several individual flowers.  ex. Maclura, fig</li>
</ul>



<h2>Families</h2>

<h3>I. <i>Lamiaceae = Labiatae</i> - mint family</h3>
<ul>
<li>square stems</li>
<li>always opposite leaves</li>
<li>often highly zygomorphic, bilabiate corollas</li>
<li>stamens 2 or 4, often 4 and didynamous (2 long, 2 short)</li>
<li>4-lobed ovary produces 4 nutlets (or less, if some ovules are abortive)</li>
<li>includes many aromatic culinary herbs, such as mint, rosemary, marjoram, and oregano</li>
<li>also includes common weeds such as Lamium amplexicaule</li>
<li>traditional name: <i>Labiatae</i></li>
</ul>

<h3>II. <i>Brassicaceae = Cruciferae</i> - mustard family</h3>
<ul>
<li>alternate leaves</li>
<li>four petals</li>
<li>four sepals</li>
<li>estipulate</li>
<li>inflorescence a raceme</li>
<li>stamens often (but not always) six, 4 long + 2 short</li>
<li>fruit a specialized 2-carpellate capsule called a silique or silicle</li>
<li>many contain sulphur compounds</li>
<li>mustard, kale, collards, turnips, and broccoli are all members of this family.</li>
<li>many mambers of this family have a peppery flavor, such as radish and horseradish.</li>
<li>traditional name: <i>Cruciferae</i></li>
</ul>
