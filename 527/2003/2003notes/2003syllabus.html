In cases of borderline grade percentages, your attendance and punctuality will be used to determine your final grade. USC policy allows for grade reduction to be enforced if 10% or more of scheduled class meetings are missed. There will be no extra credit possibilities.</p>

<p>
FIELD TRIPS. Please be prompt for field trips. The timing of field trips involves a return to campus by 430pm; every effort will be made to adhere to this. As the field trips obviously involve the outdoors, please PLAN to get dirty, as WE WILL end up in wet, muddy, messy, fire-ant-and-other-insect-filled, etc. places from time to time. Suitable field attire includes anything you wish to wear, but remember that we are often traveling through heavy brush (and stickers). Warning: shorts are NOT RECOMMENDED. While sandals and flip-flops are stylish and appropriate in many settings, they are not suitable on our field trips: PLEASE WEAR BOOTS OR TENNIS SHOES!

Recommendations for insuring your success in this course:
<ol style="margin-top:0">
<li>Attend EVERY lecture and field trip. Remember that there is a quiz in EVERY class meeting, both in lectures and on field trips!<br>
<li>Strive early on to master keying out plants by yourself...that is, without the help of others.<br>
<li>Make connections between the genera you learn and the FAMILIES to which they belong.<br>	
<li>Make every attempt to practice keying out plants away from the classroom.<br>
<li>Prepare a scrapbook of plant fragments (that is, a leaf collection) for your own reference.<br> Fragments can be collected during each field trip we take, as well as any you take by yourself. <br>This will be highly valuable for studying and as a reference source. Note that this is completely optional.<br>
