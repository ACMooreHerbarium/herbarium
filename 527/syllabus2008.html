<p>
<i>Biology majors are reminded that this is not a REQUIRED course; nevertheless, a grade of C or better is required for credit. In cases of borderline percentages, your attendance, punctuality, and class participation will be used in part to determine your final grade. USC policy allows for grade reduction to be enforced if 10% or more of scheduled class meetings are missed, with or without legitimate excuses. There will be no extra credit possibilities.</i></p></center>

<p><b>ELECTRONIC DEVICES POLICY.</b> The use of cell phones and any other electronic devices, except small tape recorders, is absolutely forbidden in all lectures and field trips. Habitual offenders may expect a grade reduction at the discretion of the instructor, as approved by the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. NO electronic devices may be used during any quiz or exam; violation in this rule will result in a grade of 0 for that quiz/exam.</p>

<p>
<b>FIELD TRIPS ARE MANDATORY.</b> Please be prompt for field trips, or you will be left behind. Destinations (see below) may be changed. The timing of field trips involves a return to campus by 430pm; every effort will be made to adhere to this schedule. As the field trips obviously involve the outdoors, please PLAN to get dirty, as WE WILL end up in wet, muddy, messy, stickery, fire-ant-and-other-insect-filled places from time to time. Suitable field attire includes anything you wish to wear; shorts are not recommended. While sandals, crocs, and flip-flops are variably stylish and appropriate in many social settings, they are not suitable on field trips.

Recommendations for insuring your success in this course:
<ol style="margin-top:0">
<li>Attend EVERY lecture and field trip. Remember that there is a quiz in EVERY class meeting, both in lectures and on field trips!<br>
<li>Strive early on to master keying out plants by yourself...that is, without the help of others.<br>
<li>Make connections between the genera you learn and the FAMILIES to which they belong.<br>	
<li>Practice keying / identifying plants OUTSIDE the classroom.<br>
<li>Prepare a scrapbook of plant fragments (that is, a leaf collection) for your own reference.<br>
</ol>
